### Design Choices

#### Typology
![Typology](static/documentation/topology.png ,"Typography Wizard Inn")

#### Fonts 
- I used standards fonts and fonts connected to [bootstrap]( https://getbootstrap.com/ ) as well as Oleo Script from [Google Fonts]( https://fonts.google.com/ ) to create a predictive behaviour of my font over several web browsers but also give some personality to my titles

#### Colors

- I focused mainly on black, white, gray colortheme to create a clear, simple and easy to read webpage, the aim is that background image should draw attention to the products and main messages

#### Wireframe
